# techbash2025

Repository for slides from TechBash 2025. I had two talks at TechBash this year:

    "Verbs, Not Nouns: Writing Documentation that Users Want to Read"
    "Networking for Introverts: Build, Maintain, and Use Networks Without Being Creepy"

This repo contains the slide decks for both talks, in PDF format. Speaker notes not included.
